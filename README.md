# Redux Todo App
This app is the product of following the [Basics][redux-basics] documentation for Redux available at
[redux.org][redux]. I'm building this app to gain exposure to the Redux library and easily refer
back to useful snippets and patterns.

## Key Terms
I've created a simple Markdown file of key terms and definitions in my own words. The document is an
aid for reviewing what I've learned about Redux in the process of building this Todo app and
reading the Redux documentation. [Go to Key Terms][key-terms].

## Additional Project-Based Tutorials
I'm a proponent of learning to code and use API through doing. To that end, Redux has gathered a
quality list of tutorials for learning to use Redux [here][redux-tutorials].
